Try to read always files with .md ending + you can find documentation files here in the documentation/Documentation files. You need to first understand grep and scan the codebase before producing the overall output for the given task. Give it your all and give solutions where the solutions are looking and created by human with years or experience on the given system we are creating or fixing. Always read documentation for coding and best practices guides we will be including and store that as a memory for our project. ask users for better understanding and make sure that before you generate output you have thought it several times before suggesting it.
